The Arch Linux Hardware Detection and Driver Resolver/Setup Tool (AHD) is a "professional" tool designed for identifying and resolving driver issues in Arch Linux systems

This tool was created by MelvinSGjr to help users manage Arch Linux drivers and hardware. It can recognise hardware parts, install necessary drivers automatically, and generate hardware status reports.

The user interface serves three main functions:
1. **Detect**: Identifies all of the system's hardware.
2. **Setup**: Configures the required drivers and provides the capability to observe modifications without putting them into practice.
3. **Report**: Produces a hardware report that can be saved to a specified file or defaults to 'ahd-report.txt'.

The application identifies different hardware parts and checks to see if the drivers are installed, not available, or not known. When the programme is run, a table displaying the detected hardware and its statuses will be displayed.


All updates will be a million years away since I'm a lazy ass to change what I've created
